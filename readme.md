# Getting Started With Conix

Conix is a Nix EDSL for technical writing. It brings the Nix
programming language alongside markdown and implements an
intuitive build system.

**Notice: This project is a work in progress. The API will be unstable
until the first major release.**

# Contributing

Any ideas or help are welcome! Please submit a PR or open an issue as you see
fit. I like to use the project board to organize my thoughts; check the todo
column for tasks to work on. I will try and convert these to issues when I can.
