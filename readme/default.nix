**Notice: This project is a work in progress and the API will have major
updates pushed to the master branch until the first major release.**

Conix is a nix library for writing documents. It's primary goal is to make it
easy to re-use pieces your content without needing to write content.
Eventually I'd like to use it to replace markdown and _maybe_ make it user
friendly enough to replace word processors (for small things).

As an example this readme file was written using conix.

# A Taste of Conix

To try out conix:

1. Copy the conix sample into `conix-sample.nix` file.
1. `nix-build ./conix-sample.nix`
1. Open the `result/Volunteers.md` file. ''#TODO: replace with generated html file.
''


__Markdown Sample__
```markdown
${builtins.readFile "${import ./sample.nix}/Volunteers.md"}
```

__Conix Sample__
```nix
${builtins.readFile ./sample.nix}
```

''#TODO: add the code samples corresponding to each item.
''
* The markdown sample was not hand written; the conix sample generated it.
* The table in the markdown sample has some of its contents duplicated across
the document. The conix sample simplifies this process.
* The number of volunteers is a computed value based on the number of rows in 
  the table:
* Conix provides an out-of-the-box build system for markdown (using
''(conix.text ["pandocLink"] "[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)")'').

# Goals

''(conix.hidden ((import ../design/goals.nix) conix))
(conix.textOf ["goals" "list"])
''


# Contributing

Any ideas or help are welcome! Please submit a PR or open an issue as you see
fit. I like to use the project board to organize my thoughts; check the todo
column for tasks to work on. I will try and convert these to issues when I can.
Please read the [./design.md](./design.md) document for the design of conix.
